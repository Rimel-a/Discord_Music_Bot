Discord Music Bot created by Robert Andion USF Computer Science.

You must place all of the files in the same directory in order for this to work.
.setup will send you a message on how to configure the bot as long as you are the server admin.

If you want to change the lavalink password you must change it in the application.yml
and in both music.py and playlist.py on the commented lines where 'changeme123' is located.
#######################################
Lava link is not my creation and can be found at:
lavalink.jar MUST BE DOWNLOADED AND PLACED IN DIRECTORY
https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases
#######################################
run the lavalink server using the command : java -jar lavalink.jar
Then run the bot in a seperate terminal using: python bot.py
Both terminals must remain running for the bot to be live, consider using tmux.
######################################
ALSO: Before many commands will work an initial "play" command will need to be made. Once this is done once
it will not need to be redone for the entirety of the bots run time.
